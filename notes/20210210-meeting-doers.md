## 2. Call-out topics

### Exploit status/aftermath
- Maker vault
    - 9.7m, 1m extra might be needed for eth vault
    - two snapshots required count diff
- Tether: Contact CTO, try to get funds back 
- Aave proposals: good to deepen partnership with them 
- Cream: Deepen co-opeartion further

#### How do we pay the DAI loan?
   - farming with treasury
   - diverting baby
   - depends a bit on priorities
   - need data/forecast for time to repay 

### Vaults & Strategies

#### Vaults v1 -> v2 plan
- Are we heading towards single token deposits to replace Curve? 
- Plan to migrate Curve v1 strats to v2?
- Wrap the v1 vault and treat it as a strategy for a v2 vault, offer single side deposit?
- Latest fix for Dai v1 has mitigation, public `earn()` cannot be enforced.
- Possible sandwich mitigations: 
   1. no deposit+withdrawal in the same block as harvest
   1. earnings maturation for 6 hrs 
   1. withdrawals using a lagging share price from 6 hrs ago 

#### BSC for boarding school / strategy testnet 
- Using BSC and Testnet for boarding school.
- BSC demand way more time from core devs/strats than a 100% school-managed testnet
- Yearn on BSC for Boarding School
- strategists in training
- low fees
- bring experience to ethereum
- help build relationship with binance
- don't distract the core team
- don't trust the system with huge amounts, keep it small ball
- Yearn's kusama?
- NO BRIDGE

#### Content/onboarding material for v2 strategies?
- Video to onboard new strategists? Maybe record a live dev AMA session (?) 

### Partnerships / Integrations
- Several in early discussions
- Rev share tiers evaluated

### Multisig transition proposal

YIP-41 expires this month. Preliminary draft of the multisig transition proposal Gabe and Trach wrote a while ago shared. Gives an idea of what was in mind but needs a lot of work still.
