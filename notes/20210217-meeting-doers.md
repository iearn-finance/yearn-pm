### 1.4 Blocked

- ychad for January

## 2. Call-out topics

### Use minted YFI in Treasury to farm & service yDAI debt

- 2800 YFI left
- sushi, bancor, yvaults all options
- Capture all DAI available in Maker
- Should we be agnostic to eth?
- Bull to prepare detailed farming proposal

### Vaults / Strategies

#### Zaps

- Build ourselves or work with Zapper
- zapper does single contract handling all zaps
- uses offchain component for routing
- simplest way is to do a simple contract, but requires 1:1 mapping
  - 1 week turnaround
  - expensive on gas
  - not upgradeable
  - redeployment of contracts when there's new tokens
- best engineering approach: 1inch style off chain routing a la zapper
- zapping in and out of vaults: a priority
- zaps between vaults: nice to have
- seems sensible to focus on core business for us, and work with zapper on zaps
- can always be revisited based on need

#### Curve voting

- vote based on TVL? least political thing to do, codified
- vote based on maximizing vecrv?
- limit vault deposits to % of gauge equal to % of our vecrv to maximize yield?
- do some maths to figure out optimized approach
- banteg to do plan / proposal and we take it from there

#### yLINK, yaLINK and yYFI

- aave based strategies with v2 aave tokens
- "you can get 20% on your link on v2, marine"
- Facu to drop in strategists as a idea for them to pursue via Sam

### New projects

- Do we plan to build out the Yearn Ecosystem / finish some of Andre's prototypes? Do we just need devs?
- there's a desire, pick the core one
- Subset:
  - ydelegate - uses aave v2 delegated credit, only creates positions doesn't balance positions. if you have credit available it shows up in the UI
  - leveragex - create flashloan to leverage the asset. pick long, short, collateral.
  - yTrade - leveraged fx trades. needs LPs.
  - options.crv.finance - not keen to push that, hegic base rewards mostly negative, underlying protocol not making money
  - defi starter - kickstarter for defi projects
