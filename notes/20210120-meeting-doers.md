- Very high expectations hard to meet them
- Rushed release
- Lots of stuff to fix, some last minute fixes not in
- Little QA
- Not all products & integrations complete
- Lack of comms caused confusion
- May need a release type of role + check list to co-ordinate better?
- More bodies working, especially on UI + design
- May have been optimistic attempting to combine contracts + web in one launch
- Earn products to be added, not the highest prio
